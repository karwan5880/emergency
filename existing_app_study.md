Malaysia has a few official and semi‑official options, but the core is still 999 voice calls and the new SaveME 999 app.​

Official Malaysia-wide options
Voice call 999 (MERS / NG MERS 999)
Still the primary national emergency line for police, ambulance, fire, APM, and maritime; the new “Next Generation MERS 999 (NG MERS 999)” backend adds caller ID, geolocation, digital mapping and other tech but you still just dial 999.​

SaveME 999 / NG SaveME999 app (public)
New official app on iOS/Android that sits on top of NG MERS 999; lets you send an emergency report with location, photos/video, text, and also supports a 999 call via an in‑app slider.​
It is meant as an additional multimedia channel, not a replacement for 999 calls, and integrates with PDRM, KKM, Bomba, APM and APMM.​

For responders and special groups
Responder app (for emergency agencies, not public)
Companion app for emergency personnel in the NG MERS 999 ecosystem, used to receive and manage incident info from the SaveME 999 system.​

Legacy special‑needs variants (Blind/Deaf/Police)
Earlier SaveME variants designed for blind, deaf and specific reporting are now merged into the single SaveME 999 app, which is supposed to cover accessibility with text/video, etc.​

Other SOS-style features you might actually use
Not “Malaysia 999” per se, but commonly used here and worth knowing:

Grab in‑app SOS
Grab has an SOS button inside rides that can connect you to emergency contacts or a safety hotline and share trip details with support, meant for incidents during bookings.​

Phone OS emergency features
Android and iOS both have native SOS functions (side‑button presses, emergency contacts, location sharing), which can still dial 999 in Malaysia and broadcast your location; these are often faster than opening a third‑party app in a real emergency.​

From a practical standpoint in Sungai Buloh, the priority stack is: configure your phone’s built‑in SOS, rely on a plain 999 call first, and treat SaveME 999 as an optional extra channel if you have time and data.​
